# CPL_MiniCompiler_C
Final project of "Compilation and Translation theory" course from my degree (Bsc Conputer Engineering). This mini compiler is for a very simple language (C like). Need to add: Flow Chart of the compilation process, Big paragraph about the project, Symbol Table structure, Guide to run the compiler, Capabilities (What it can compile).
